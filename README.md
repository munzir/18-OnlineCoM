## [18a-CreatePoses](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18a-CreatePoses)
This project contains multiple scripts to generate different sets of poses to be used for data analysis.

## [18b-SimulatePoses](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18b-SimulatePoses)
This project reads an input file of poses and simulates the motion of reaching the next pose.

## [18c-ParameterConvergence](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18c-ParameterConvergence)
This project attempts to converge to a set of parameters (mass & CoM for each robot body) given a set of input poses by generating a phi matrix and using learning on the input data.

## [18d-BalancingWithCOMError](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18g-BalancingWithCOMError)
This project performs active disturbance rejection control to stabilize the robot despite an inaccurate reading of the center of mass.

## [18e-OnlineCoMPaper](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18e-OnlineCoMPaper)
Repository containing files for the Online Center of Mass Estimation Paper.

## [18f-Trajectory Planning](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18f-TrajectoryPlanning)
This project attempts to plan a safe trajectory for a series of poses.

## [18g-OnlineCOMEstimation](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18g-OnlineCOMEstimation)
This project implements the full pipeline of online center of mass estimation.
From an initial position, the robot moves (18f) to specified poses as generated by 18a and 18c. When reaching these poses, the robot balances (18d) using active disturbance rejection control. The balanced pose is then used to update its current parameters to converge to parameters which model its x center of mass (18c).
