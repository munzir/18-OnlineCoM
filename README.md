# [18: OnlineCoM](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18-OnlineCoM)
Codebase for the OnlineCoM, including scripts created during the progress of the project.

## [18a: Create Poses](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18a-CreatePoses)
This project contains multiple scripts to generate different sets of poses to be used for data analysis.

## [18b: Simulate Poses](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18b-SimulatePoses)
This project reads an input file of poses and simulates the motion of reaching the next pose.

## [18c: Parameter Convergence](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18c-ParameterConvergence)
This project attempts to converge to a set of parameters (mass & CoM for each robot body) given a set of input poses by generating a phi matrix and using learning on the input data.

## 18d: Disturbance Control
This project performs disturbance rejection control to stabilize the robot
despite an inaccurate reading of the center of mass.

## [18e: Online CoM Paper](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18e-OnlineCoMPaper)
Repository containing files for IEEE Humanoids submission.

## [18f: Trajectory Planning](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18f-TrajectoryPlanning)
This project attempts to plan a safe trajectory for a series of poses.

## [Miscellaneous](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18-OnlineCoM/tree/master/misc)
Directory containing miscellaneous files that do not relate to the OnlineCoM
project but are still pertinent to the other aspects of the Krang Lab Group.

## [Pose Datasets](http://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18-OnlineCoM/tree/master/poseDatasets)
Directory containing datsets on poses for Krang.
