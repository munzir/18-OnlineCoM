# 18OnlineCoM
Codebase for the OnlineCoM, including scripts created during the progress of the project.

## 18a: Create Poses
This project contains multiple scripts to generate different sets of poses to be used for data analysis.

## 18b: Simulate Poses
This project reads an input file of poses and simulates the motion of reaching the next pose.

## 18c: Parameter Convergence
This project attempts to converge to a set of parameters (mass & CoM for each robot body) given a set of input poses by generating a phi matrix and using learning on the input data.

## 18d: Disturbance Control
This project performs disturbance rejection control to stabilize the robot
despite an inaccurate reading of the center of mass.

## 18e: To Be Announced
