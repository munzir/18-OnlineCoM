# [18: OnlineCoM](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18OnlineCoM)
Codebase for the OnlineCoM, including scripts created during the progress of the project.

## [18a: Create Poses](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18aCreatePoses)
This project contains multiple scripts to generate different sets of poses to be used for data analysis.

## [18b: Simulate Poses](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18bSimulatePoses)
This project reads an input file of poses and simulates the motion of reaching the next pose.

## [18c: Parameter Convergence](https://github.gatech.edu/WholeBodyControlAttempt1/18cParameterConvergence)
This project attempts to converge to a set of parameters (mass & CoM for each robot body) given a set of input poses by generating a phi matrix and using learning on the input data.

## 18d: Disturbance Control
This project performs disturbance rejection control to stabilize the robot
despite an inaccurate reading of the center of mass.

## 18e: To Be Announced
