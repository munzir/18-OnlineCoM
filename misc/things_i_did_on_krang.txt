> Ethernet port does not have internet

> Ethernet cable does not work
-> Checked on personal laptop
--> Ethernet cable works

> Interface (wlan0) doesnt work properly
-> Looked into the /etc/network/interfaces file
Believe the problem is the fact that eth0 is configured as `static`
IP address is hardcoded 192.168.1.54
Gateway is hardcoded 192.168.1.1
Network is hardcoded 255.255.255.0
Another issue may be the fact of using `allow-hotplug`
Refer to `man interfaces` for more information

Possible solution: Edit this file and configure the eth0 interface to
dynamically acquire an IP address via `dhcp`
Proposed eth0 configuration:
# Could change `allow-hotplug` to `auto` to make internet connection with less hurdles
# Problem is that using `auto` might be dangerous since krang would try to
# connect to internet whenever it can (may lead to unsupervised connections that
# could result in possible cyber attacks on krang)
# allow-hotplug should work with events like "being detected by udev hotplug
# api" or "cable linked"
# Thorough configuration flags can be found via `man interfaces`
auto-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

Created a copy of old `/etc/network/interfaces` file as `interfaces_original`
and an the proposed solution file as `interfaces_edited`
Have not edited the actual file yet
--> Awaiting verdict
*** Still need to test with the edited file ***

> dhclient is not connecting to interface properly
-> Created a copy of the original /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file called
dhclient_original.conf
Have not made any changes to the file
--> Awaiting verdict
** Have not edited the actual dhclient.conf file yet **
