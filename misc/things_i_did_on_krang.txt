What is the problem?
>Krang needs internet

>Possible avenues of failure
-> Solution/Method
--> Verdict

> Ethernet port does not have internet
-> Checked on personal laptop
--> Ethernet port has internet

> Ethernet cable does not work
-> Checked on personal laptop
--> Ethernet cable works

> Interface (wlan0) doesnt work properly
-> Looked into the /etc/network/interfaces file
Believe the problem is the fact that eth0 is configured as `static`
IP address is hardcoded 192.168.1.54
Gateway is hardcoded 192.168.1.1
Network is hardcoded 255.255.255.0
Another issue may be the fact of using `allow-hotplug`
Refer to `man interfaces` for more information

Possible solution: Edit this file and configure the eth0 interface to
dynamically acquire an IP address via `dhcp`
Proposed eth0 configuration:
# Could change `allow-hotplug` to `auto` to make internet connection with less hurdles
# Problem is that using `auto` might be dangerous since krang would try to
# connect to internet whenever it can (may lead to unsupervised connections that
# could result in possible cyber attacks on krang)
# allow-hotplug should work with events like "being detected by udev hotplug
# api" or "cable linked"
# Thorough configuration flags can be found via `man interfaces`
# Kept the lo configuration from previous version of file
auto-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

Created a copy of old `/etc/network/interfaces` file as `interfaces_original`
and an the proposed solution file as `interfaces_edited`
Edited the file
--> Internet connection cannot be established
IP address does change however, this means the IP address for the ssh is
different now
-> Edited the file to add wlan0 configuration (same as previous eth0 changes)
Generated an avahi interface
--> Deemed to be a confusion of interface ports
Predictions: eth0 is the ssh port
lo is the port to itself
wlan0 is the ethernet or wireless not sure
Should be: lo: itself
eth0: ethernet
wlan0: ssh (wireless)

> dhclient is not connecting to interface properly
-> Created a copy of the original /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file called
dhclient_original.conf
Have not made any changes to the file
Could try to use my laptop's dhclient.conf file as reference
File contents are the same
--> Not changed since contents are the same

>dhclient/dhcp is not working
-> Try to use another network manager like netctl
Need to install it locally via package on USB
--> Still need to try
